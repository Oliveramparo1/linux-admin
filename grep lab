1.grep "Street" datebook
This command works by searching for the word Street and printing the lines that have it
2.grep "^J" datebook
Because all the lines start with a name. I just need to search the start of every line for the letter J to print 
all the names that start with J.
3.grep "000$" datebook
The $ searches for things at the end of a line and I wanted to search for lines that ended in 3 0s.
4.grep -v "408" datebook
The -v reverses whatever I am doing. I searched for 408 and instead of printing them it prints the lines that do not
contain it
5.grep 3/../.. datebook
I realized that I can use the pattern of the dates as a way to search for them and the month of march is month 3. It
prints all the lines that contain a birthday in march.
6.grep 8..-...-.... datebook
This is basically the same as the previous. I used the pattern of the phone numbers to print all the phone number that start with an 8
and that the dots represent random numbers in the phone numbers
7.grep "[A-Z][a-z][a-z][a-z][a-z], [A-Z]" datebook
This searches for a pattern of capital, lower case letterts, commands, a space and another upper case letter. The [A-Z] shows all the letters that are capital
and [a-z] letters that are lower case.
8.grep ":.. [A-Z]\|:... [A-Z]" datebook
There is a pattern in the datebook where there is a colon everytime there is a adress and I made it look for random two digit and 3 digit number adresses 
9.grep "MA ." datebook
This searches any line that contain "MA". In the question it asked me to find a number after the letters MA and that is what the dot is for.
10.grep -v "Street" datebook| grep -v "St"
The -v reverces the output so that it excludes Street and St.
